### Instructions for beginners mostly

- On Windows 10, use the Chocolatey pack manager to install yarn with the command belou:
$ choco install yarn
- Make sure u have the right priviledges to perform such tasks! You might need to open your terminal/cmd/powershell as administrator. In this case I used git bash (MINGW64) as admin opened with the right button of the mouse.
- Whatever information you cannot fins in here, means that you need to search/research/google for it yourself. You really need get goot at this!
- Checking the versions of the package managers for Javascript I've had already installed in my computer:
$ node -v
v15.1.0
$ npm -v
7.0.8
$ yarn -version
1.22.5
- Use your VSCode Integrated Git Bash Terminal only as git/github cli, for status, commit and push for example.
